## Customizable & Compiled Programming Language

This repository contains the CCPL project, a compiled
<br>programming language which aims to allow the user
<br>to be as free as possible

### The rules which define CCPL are:
- CCPL shall never produce a proprietary software
- CCPL shall allow its user to be as free as possible
- CCPL should be understandable by anyone in any of its forms
- CCPL should be usable by anyone anywhere

#### CCPL is open source:
#### CCPL promotes liberty:
#### CCPL is always readable:
#### CCPL is for everyone:
 This means the CCPL compiler (CCPLc) is being developed 
 <br>for most CPUs and architechture. Currently a first
 <br>version of CCPLc is in the proccess of being written
 <br>for x86-64 elf files. However once the first version will
 <br>be completed the others will soon follow, this is because
 <br>the main challenges the compiler has to beat are not
 <br>CPU-Dependant nor based on a specific architechture.
