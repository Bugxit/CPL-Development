## What is CPL exactly?
### - What does CPL stands for?
  As you might have seen in the title, CPL stands for :
```
Customizable Programming Language
```
### - Why "Customizable"?
  As the name might suggest, the main attribute of CPL is to be "Customizable".
  <br>However, most of you already asked yourself what "Customizable" means for a programing language?
  <br>Don't worry, it is as easy as it can get : Every element (grammar, etc) CPL uses can be changed in to whatever you want. For example consider:
  ```
write ("Hello, world!");
  ```
  <br> and:
```
dontwrite (-Hello, world!-)/
```
<br>These two examples both work the same but they just have different settings (first example uses default settings):
```
write  ->  dontwrite
  "    ->      -
  ;    ->      /
```

### - What if my friend and I don't use the same settings?
  When learning about the customizable feature of CPL you probably thought it could bring some 
  <br>issues. (We all have that one friend who would like to use the weirdest grammar possible)
  <br>To address this issue, there exists a feature which automaticaly changes the grammar in a CPL file to your own grammar.
  <br>In case you want to learn more about doing this : please follow [this link](#use-intern-features-of-cpl)

### - Is CPL compiled?
  CPL is a language compiled in NASM for the x86-64 CPU family, however this temporary and
  <br>CPL will soon support more CPUs. 

### - Who is working on the CPL project?
  Sadly, I (aka Bugxit) am working alone on the CPL project, which explains the lack of updates and new features.
  <br>But, being alone doesn't mean you can't produce things as good as a team (or does it?). 
  <br>I am still taking this project seriously and I am trying my best to make this PL the best it can be!

### - What are the goals of CPL?
  Since CPL is compiled it is an extremely fast language, further more it aims at allowing a faster approach 
  <br>to the Bignums used in Python & Javascript.
